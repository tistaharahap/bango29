It's this time of the year again. I want to say Happy 7th of August everyone! This year has been nothing short of a blessed year. It's incredible how just 1 year can have so many changes yet it's only a year.

I got the best birthday present **ever** from my wife.

It's been my dream since I was a kid to be a pilot. It came true for 60 minutes. Thank you wife! For 2 years in a row you gave me something I've been passionate for my whole life. I love you.

On Thursday this week, we moved into a new permanent home. Still a lot of work to do. So so so grateful.

Our son Jeremia has his own room, the whole 3rd floor. Now it's filled with all of his toys, a tent set, a really cool but a bit hazardous slider and an aircon that's struggling to keep us cool. No TV there.

Ever since we limit our son to TV, iPad, etc, everything changes for him. Seriously, for parents with children from 0-2 years, keep the gadgets away.

All and all, The Guy above is very kind. He understands. Thank you J.
