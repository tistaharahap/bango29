This weekend is spent trying out and figuring out the latest Mac OS X evolution which is Lion. It's my second time installing Lion, the first time was with the first seed released by Apple. This time is the so called Gold Release that will most likely be prime candidate for a full release.

I got this DMG from the usual suspects and while reading its installation instruction, I was glad to know that it doesn't involve any DVD disc to do so. The DMG was already enough and on my 10.6.7 Snow Leopard, I mounted the DMG and followed the instructions. I choose to upgrade my Snow Leopard to Lion. To my surprise, it was dead easy.

The installer went ahead by copying the files needed for the real installation routine, after that it prompted me to restart. I followed through and the installation routine just does what it's supposed to do with a very minimal intervention. The whole process took about 40 minutes to finish.

First boot was excruciatingly slow reaching my desktop. I figured I should reboot one more time and do a little analyzing. The second time it was on my desktop, I noticed that Spotlight is heavily indexing all of my files. A deal breaker indeed, it made my Early 2011 Macbook Pro 13" harddrive felt increasingly shadowed by SSD drives. Here's a screenshot of my Lion desktop.

If you notice on the bottom left, my Dock is showing 2 new icons just beside the Finder icon which are Launchpad and Mission Control.

Launchpad is like when you're on an iOS device flicking through all the applications/games installed within your device. This indeed is a sign of a touch enabled Lion devices is not a hoax. Mission Control is what you get when you usually use Expose to switch between your applications, with Mission Control, you can also see all your desktops. Application can be dragged and dropped into any desktop you want. This is convenient, it takes logically partitioning your desktop a step further.

One of the first thing you would notice is that scrolling up and down is backwards. This is yet another indicator that Lion is already a touch friendly OS. To change this behavior, System Preferences is the place to go.

Since upgrading into Lion I have several applications not running the way it should be, here are the list of applications I have right now that are not working:
<ul>
	<li>NX Client - Not Working</li>
	<li>Tuxera NTFS - Not Working</li>
	<li>Perian - Not Working</li>
</ul>
Performance wise, I am not too satisfied with Lion but hey this is not a full release, I hope Apple do get ahead with Spotlight, it's ridiculously not cool. I'm gonna post updates along the way. Thanks for reading.
