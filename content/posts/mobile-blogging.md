This is my premier mobile blogging post. I must say I didn't expect Wordpress to create its own Blackberry application.

I was quite disgusted with Wordpress' email-to-post feature. Just didn't seem mobile enough lol.

With the enormous growth of Blackberry users in the world (particularly in Indonesia), I guess Wordpress doesn't mind a bit of Java coding to grab a piece of the pie.

Anyways, I haven't dissect the application thoroughly. My first glimpse while I was composing this post was its lack of a rich text editor. To be honest, since Blackberries use scrolls as it interface, a rich text editor might be a little bit annoying. Keyboard shortcuts will be great though :)

Will post more soon...
