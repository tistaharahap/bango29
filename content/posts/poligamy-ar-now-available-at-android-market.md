Yippy now Poligamy is available at Android Market globally :) Need everyone's help to tear down and find bugs with the app so I decided to publish it. I'm game for a bug huting session!

By using your own Android Market app, search for Poligamy or Augmented Reality as the search terms. Better yet, you can scan the QR code below and it will take you to the app.

Please comment and or review the app. Feature requests are welcomed most definitely.

Some updates, I'm currently redesigning the User Interface with a great UI Builder Mr. <a href="http://twitter.com/andreasfendri" target="_blank">Andreas Fendri</a>. You should talk about proper UI layout &amp; design with him. He's a maestro at what he do.

Enjoy the app guys, your feedback is definitely appreciated. Thank you.
