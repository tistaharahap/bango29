In most second semesters of Computer Science courses in Indonesia, students will learn about a course called `Data Structure`. In my case, it was a course about `LinkedList` taught in the `C` language. Of all the courses I took, this was the only one worth remembering all this time. Having an ever-connected list in which every node points to its previous and next nodes. The first being the `head` while the last is its `tail`. It's time for a new `head`.

Over the past 2 years I've been working fully remote, I love how it has impacted my life but more to how it has impacted people in the company. Remote work requires discipline and a mature mindset. Making a habit of working effectively and being transparent about it. Although nothing beats an after-hours session in the office goofing about whatever or drinks with friends, eventually I adapted.

Built a cryptocurrency enabled platform to which I think only a handful of companies in Indonesia have also built. Not just a simple `ERC20` contract to define a cryptocurrency, we built a whole platform. To say the technical challenges are interesting is the least of the learning. Building PlayGame introduced me to how the world works, plain and uncensored.

Just like a `LinkedList`, learning something new lets the `head` be redefined over and over. Knowledge can't be contained into just 1 node, it's too vast and with it comes choices on what to learn next. The favorite part of being a software engineer is learning, applying the discipline to other types of knowledge is an experiment I love doing.

The above said, as of today I no longer hold the CTO position in both PlayGame and MainGame.

I'd also like to publish something new today. I've been writing a new trading bot for the last 2 weeks. It's called `neobabix`. Will have a full write-up about this later. I've built a few trading bots before, `neobabix` is a sum of all the knowledge and experience I've learned before.

The main focus of the bot being `Strategy` and `Playbook`. A strategy is a way to produce `Long` or `Short` signals while a playbook is a set of instructions on how to trade. More often than not, the number once cause of missed opportunities or even loss is the unreliable nature of exchange API's.

I invite anyone reading this to [have a look here](https://github.com/tistaharahap/neo-babix).
