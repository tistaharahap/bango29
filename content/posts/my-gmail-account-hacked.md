Okay,

To all of you who received an email from tistaharahap [at] gmail [dot] com earlier this evening around 2.15 AM (GMT +7), please ignore it. It was sent without me knowing. I don't know how the sender got my password but the emails certainly got my signature in every emails the sender sent.

[caption id="attachment_240" align="alignnone" width="340" caption="The Sender was from Poland"]<a href="http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-14-at-3.03.31-AM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-240  " title="The Sender was from Poland" src="http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-14-at-3.03.31-AM.png" alt="The Sender was from Poland" width="340" height="118" /></a>[/caption]

I've never been from Poland and the country should be in a state of national grieve but someone from there (according to the log above) used my GMAIL account. Further investigation reveals these facts:
<ul>
	<li>Hostname: nat166.zamek.net.pl</li>
	<li>City: Bedzin, 35 -</li>
	<li>ISP: ZAMEKNET S.C.</li>
	<li>Latitude: 50Â°33'33" North</li>
	<li>Longitude: 19Â°15'00" East</li>
	<li>ISP Admin Names: Bartosz Bachowski and Michal Hankus</li>
	<li>ISP Admin Email: biuro [at] zamek.net.pl</li>
</ul>
The email contains a link to <strong>http://sites.google [dot] com/site/hgy6egduo/oesw7u</strong> and on that page there's an image from ImageShack that has been removed because it violate's ImageShack's TOS. When you click on the image, it goes directly to a website <strong>wikarvuava [dot] com</strong>. It's said to be a Canadian Health &amp; Care Mall selling Viagra and other "potent" drugs lol. A quick WHOIS for the domain reveal:
<ul>
	<li>Owner: Michael Pritz</li>
	<li>Address: 704 Morgantown Avenue</li>
	<li>ZIP: 26554</li>
	<li>Town: Fairmount</li>
	<li>Country: USA</li>
	<li>Telephone: +1.3043663665</li>
	<li>Email: hokerindo [at] nycmail.com</li>
</ul>
So if any of you guys felt irritated by the emails the sender sent, please I implore you to join me up and send emails to the ISP admins or the "potent" drugs website owner.

This is <strong>BAD</strong> SEO/Spam tactics. Well anyways, my apologies for the emails, I've changed my password. Thanks.
