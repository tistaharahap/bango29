These past weeks, I've been amazed by the amazing performance offered by <a href="https://github.com/ahiguti/HandlerSocket-Plugin-for-MySQL">HandlerSocket</a> right out of the box. You'd amaze yourself after reading a <a title="Using MySQL as a NoSQL - A story for exceeding 750,000 qps on a commodity server" href="http://yoshinorimatsunobu.blogspot.com/2010/10/using-mysql-as-nosql-story-for.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> by Yoshinori Matsunobu about the topic, he managed to get 750 thousands queries per second!

Well I wanted to try it on my own and see how it goes. Here's a CodeIgniter library intended just for that!
