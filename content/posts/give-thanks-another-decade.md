Every 10 years (or so) of time spent, there will come decisions or moments that will change how the next 10 years will look like, at least this is how it is in my life. My late teens to my late twenties were defined by my perseverance to reinvent (find?) myself that was helped with an obscene amount of alcohol and good times. Late twenties to my late thirties is when I focused everything into understanding how the world works by working and building startups. This is the next reinvention of myself.

I had fun throughout the last 2 decades, I really did, and to top it off everything that I set as my goals are all accomplished. There were 2 starting distinct moments out of those 2 decades that really shaped me, all of them came with the help of my friends, just like what [The Beatles wrote üòçüòç](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C58ttB2-Qg)

## Decade 0

Being a software engineer, numbers start from 0 for me and it sort of fit nicely in this post's progression. At the time, I was pursuing higher education at [Universitas Bina Nusantara](https://binus.ac.id/) with a double degree program in Mathematics and Computer Science. This was exciting for me, I learned programming from when I was much much younger and going to this place should validate me right? Or at least that was what I had in mind.

It didn't.

You see, I always knew who I am and who I want to be ever since I wrote my first Hello World program. I was also lucky enough to have an Internet connection at home, what I learned from the Internet were in contrast of what I got in university. This didn't sit right with me, this is my life and my ego back then were up there (still am). But there was 1 subject that I appreciate, I talked about this all the time as the only subject that matters: Data Structure. This opened my eyes that primitive types are now much more elegant when grouped together by a construct to say it simply. It stuck with me to this day.

I have a friend, her name is [Indira Dian Saraswaty](https://twitter.com/indynesia), she and I are friends since we were toddlers. She likes Star Trek, that in itself is without exaggeration, oomph factor, full stop. I distinctly remember meeting her somewhere in Kemang, we were going to meet some other friends somewhere else, although we went to different schools later but we hung out with the same friends. We had a conversation and I told her about what I had in mind. I still remember talking and then something clicked when one of us talked about studying abroad. I convinced myself at that moment that I need to study elsewhere.

Never really thanked you Ndy about the inspiration, this is the time, **THANK YOU!** And bless you! Our conversation changed my life.

Still needed to convince someone else at this point. Long story short, I got what I needed. I went against family with this decision but I was also convinced the only person who knows me is me. When I started my days at [Limokwing University College](https://www.limkokwing.net/) I was full of energy. As it turns out, same shit different smell. In retrospect, I don't think there are any higher education institutions I knew of at the time that can beat the collective knowledge of the Internet but please consider the statement as less informed, come on I was young and reckless.

With those 2 experiences I convinced myself the Internet is where I should educate myself. I did. Most of the skills and knowledge I've accumulated to this day I would say comes from the Internet. Being an early adopter of the Internet, it helped me filter the noise, I was great at consuming information. With every drop of knowledge, I keep getting curious about the arts and crafts of writing codes.

Indonesia at the time is not the best place to be at in terms of technology. I had all this energy building up but nothing to show for.

## Decade 1

I'm blessed with friendships that will last a lifetime. One of them, [Ervand Daniel](https://www.instagram.com/ervand_/). Out of college, he was an entrepreneur from day 1. That I admire from him. He was successful and built his business from scratch into one of the bigger Event Organizer in Indonesia. What I learned from him is knowing yourself and committing to it. He was and still is my role model. **THANK YOU CUY!**

This decade also started with the wise words of Uncle Paul who said to me:

> "Work as an employee, understand how a company works and only then can you build your own company"

At the time I knew I wanted to build my own company, I have a lot to prove for myself, I can't do it as an employee. But my Uncle was right, I had zero experience.

The first 2 companies I worked at were companies with ~2000 people employed, one of them a public company. Other than the usuals you'd learn working in a company, I also learned that although I had colleagues there who are tech people, not everyone wants to be as geeky as me. Most will be satisfied with the what while I was more interested with the how and the why. We were an internal team but we acted like professional outsourced employees, there were zero engineering culture.

Again I find myself in the same situation like I was in the first decade. I don't fit in. Little did I know, this decade would be a decade filled with an immense amount of perseverance.

I started a few companies in this decade but the first one really defines who I am from a technical point of view. Do you remember Yahoo Open Hack Day 2009? It was a 24 hour hackathon held in many parts of the world, one of them in Jakarta, Indonesia. The Jakarta event was the most succesful in terms of Wifi connectivity. Remember, this was 2009, there were no fancy hardware at the time to handle hundreds of simultaneous Wifi connections and not to mention switching only 54 Mbps theoretical Wifi bandwidth. I put together 10 of the infamous Linksys WRT-54G and loaded them with a Linux firmware. Another friend set up pfSense to serve a captive portal. This was a professional output with amateur-ish execution. It was technically excellent powered by knowledge from the Internet.

You don't need a degree to be excellent, you just need yourself.

It wasn't smooth sailing, I failed many times. I even managed to not have enough money when my son was born but we came out of the hospital having more money than we need after paying the bills. It's proven in my life that someone else is watching over me especially in my moments of failure. This is also a good time to give thanks to God, You are never far although I keep a distance, I feel it's true that God judge you by your heart, not just by your actions (or lack of it). **Thank you Jesus!**.

Also, this was a decade full of abundance, I managed to exit a startup I built with friends [Andreas Fendri](https://twitter.com/afendris) and [Dharma Utomo](https://twitter.com/dharmautomo). We had our worst moments and best moments in life didn't we? **Thank you** for the experience guys! From 3 to ~50 people, what a moment to live for! Sehat Sejahtera Bersama! The team we built was a humble team who helped each other, proud! One guy wrote a crypto arbitrage bot and he gave it to us, immediately people contributed to optimize and execute the bot faster and better. Being an arbitrage bot, execution time is the number one factor for profit, we did it with Python, nothing else. We also collected donations after a huge period of profit and donated them, it's humbling to have led such an amazing team, best team ever!

In hindsight, the last 2 decades shaped me, I lived my life the way I want to live it and with that comes the consequence/opportunity of making things happen for myself. When my son was born, it was a changing moment of adjusting my world views to align with his future. I started to conceptualize my relationship with money in a different way, it's a means to an end, a tool to take me from point A to B to C to D and wherever I want to be. Even more true in the last years for the second decade, the highest risk is doing nothing or doing the same thing expecting different results. At this point I contemplated the seeds for a radical change for the next decade.

I fell in love with Australia and its education system. I went to visit my brother there twice and we had conversations about how he is being educated. He's got the chance to participate in building an electric truck which is a project his college is doing. This shook me to the core, can you imagine the kind of geekiness and engineering culture that's involved with such learning experience? It's a bit late for me but it's still early for my son.

The Australian education system only allows children that are 7 years old and older to enroll as a student without the parents living and working in Australia. With this constraint I came to these conclusions:

* It's possible for my son to receive a better education elsewhere
* The possibility of point 1 is a goal to achieve

Like clockwork, without me realizing, I was drawn to the challenge of education which brings me to where I started in the first place. Only this time, it's for my son.

## Decade 2

The year 2020 as we all know is the year when the world paused for a few months. At this time, I decided to stop working and immersed myself with what to do next. I never really give much thought about what to do next, I tried other things I haven't really focused on before. It was great for a while but I find myself less of an impact and it brought me into an endless spiral of questioning myself, especially; who am I?

Although this decade started a few years before 2020 or at least how it is in my head, in end of 2019 through the whole 2020, I bought myself some time to think. I wasn't so lucky in the previous decades, everything just happens and I follow through. It got me to places but in retrospect I was barely in control of the direction. I didn't want that for this decade, I had to dig down and ask hard questions to myself.

The hardest question I've shared in the first paragraph, who am I? As do with other complicated problems, the best answer is usually simple and easy to explain. I'm a father, there's no joy in me in any other answer I've contemplated. Since knowing I'm becoming a father, I took greater risks because I understood there's no change without risks. My son is my catalyst. This will never change.

I'm not proud of the father I was but I can change that. Small things like checking up on my son every few hours in weekdays in working hours may not seem much but if you add it up in a year, it will shape him as a human being, a kind one I hope.

Programming has been part of my identity ever since I was little but more true I feel is tinkering. That curiousity you get when you want to understand something is addictive. I never had problems with loneliness, there was just too many unknowns in the world to explore. On a Monday afternoon I can help a junior engineer with his programming troubles yet in the night I'm learning how to flare an airplane just before touching down to the ground. There's an infinite number of knowledge one can accummulate in a lifetime.

Knowing something is not the same with experiencing something and each is dependent of each other to master a skill. For almost 30 years I've been in love with programming and to a larger extent, how computing works, this will never fade, ever.
