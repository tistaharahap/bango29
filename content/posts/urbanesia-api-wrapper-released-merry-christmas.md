Before anything else, I would love to say MERRY CHRISTMAS to everyone, have a great holiday and may the Christmas spirit make all of us ready for 2011. God bless you all :) This 2 days I've been working on a wrapper class to wrap Urbanesia's OAuth and xAuth authentication for our API. The main idea was to keep it as simple and as easy as possible. Here's my Christmas present :)

For this to happen, you must sign up for Consumer Tokens. We're still working on an automated system for it so in the mean time, you can email superhero [at] urbanesia [dot] com for early access. I used GIT this time for the versioning software to experience something new this Christmas. The files are already uploaded at <a href="http://r.bango29.com/eG6QiH" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. To get a taste of Urbanesia's vast data, you can go <a href="http://r.bango29.com/gyvwIn" target="_blank">here</a> and spend some time with the README, after that, creativity is the limit :D

To wrap things up, Merry Christmas to everyone and have a great 2011!
