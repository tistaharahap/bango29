This is it!

It feels like everything that I've done back in 2009 is leading me to 2010. I have no idea how 2010 is gonna affect me, it's not my privilege to say what's gonna happen. I'm just adding it all up and now, it's becoming more of a fact than merely dreams.

My gratefulness span to my family and friends who are always been a part of me. Your motivation to me has always been perceived in a positive way. Thank you to Yosephine for your undying love for me and for your endless patience. You are and always will be my driving force.

Last but least, to J Who is more than anyone else, the Giver of my passion and my source of joy and happiness. You gave me a purpose in this temporary life. Thy will be done, use me as Your vessel to share Your Greatness.

Happy new year 2010 everyone, let's make things happen!
