The latest collection of websites we have worked with. It is a website focused to working women with children. The perception of glamour and feminine looks are the 2 main ideas in designing this website.

The website is targeted to become a community. The inclusion of a FORUM (bulletin board), CHAT feature and an individual BLOG for every registered users are the backbone of this upcoming community.

If all goes according to plan, it will be launched sometime around February 2007. HereÃ¢â¬â¢s a screenshot of the website.
