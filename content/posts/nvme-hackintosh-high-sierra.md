A few months ago I wrote about my [2018 Hackintosh](https://bango29.com/hackintosh-2018-upgrades/) which I've just upgraded again. This time by adding an NVMe drive into the motherboard. A blog post [here](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/324306-nvme-native-support-in-1013/) made me very excited to try it out for myself.

I chose a [Samsung SSD 960 EVO 250GB](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/solid-state-drives/ssd-960-evo-m-2-250gb-mz-v6e250bw/) because of its unprecedented [benchmark scores](http://ssd.userbenchmark.com/SpeedTest/200373/Samsung-SSD-960-EVO-250GB). Samsung claims it's up to 3x speedier than regular SSD's although benchmarks shows the number to be 2x.

To get a full experience I did a fresh hackintosh install. The benchmark below speaks for itself.

The most notable difference is when I do programming in `PyCharm`, my 2017 Macbook Pro lags behind. The only thing I could think of to speed things up is to upgrade the CPU on this hackintosh into an i7-7600k. There are impulses to go ahead upgrade the motherboard and CPU for Coffee Lake but that'd be too much #haha.
