Back in November 2009, Yahoo! South East Asia held its first Yahoo! Open Hack South East Asia event. It's an event for web developers to explore their minds using web tools &amp; services hosted by Yahoo.

They are launching arrays of services that will definitely leverage the web applications you are building.

Contestants were registered from around South East Asia, guessed who won the competition? An Indonesia of course! Be proud Indonesians!

With the event, they also launch a video presentation for Indonesian Geeks hehehe. Proud to be one of them!
