Titiek Puspa is one of IndonesiaÃ¢â¬â¢s widely honored artist. She has come a long way from just singing for fun. Exactly like that, the websiteÃ¢â¬â¢s concept was conceived. The design featured colors and textures that are very Indonesian and very close to Titiek PuspaÃ¢â¬â¢s heart.

The principal technology behind the website is nothing more than the usuals which are Linux, Apache, PHP &amp; MySQL. Created a custom built CMS upon them.
