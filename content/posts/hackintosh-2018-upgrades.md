Leveraging the upgradeability of a Hackintosh, I made some more upgrades. The most notable is water cooling and a new Nvidia 1050 Ti GPU. It's now the beefiest spec of any hardware I own.

The specs are now:

* Intel Core i3 6100
* Corsair H60 CPU Watercooling
* Biostar B250-GT3 Motherboard
* Nvidia 1050 Ti 4 GB
* 20 GB DDR4 RAM
* 120 GB WD Green SSD
* 1 TB Toshiba HDD
* Fenvi FV-T919 Wifi AC/Bluetooth Adapter

I was aiming for a quiet Hackintosh, that I got by using water cooling. However, you still need to calibrate the radiator fan from BIOS or else the radiator fan will always run at its maximum RPM.

Aiming for a quiet PC, that stock CPU fan screams like crazy. The radiator did its job cooling the CPU but still have to calibrate the radiator fan from BIOS. And upgraded this hackintosh w/ a 1050ti, xplane! <a href="https://t.co/rBBWh0SQCM">pic.twitter.com/rBBWh0SQCM</a></p>&mdash; Batista Harahap (@tista) <a href="https://twitter.com/tista/status/960582817049489408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2018</a></blockquote>

Loving my Hackintosh build more and more, the ability to upgrade it anytime I want is luxury when you're used to Apple built Macs.
