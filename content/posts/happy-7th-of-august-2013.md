It has come to this specific day of the year. The 7th of August! Wishing everyone a happy and joyous day today. Thank you for all the well wishes from friends and family. I am grateful I am incremented for another year.

Especially this year because this is the last unmarried 7th of August in my life. The years following this day, I will be married to fine and loving woman whom last night has given me more will and strength to keep going and do what I do best.

Every 7th of August is a special moment for us because that's the exact date exactly 1 year ago that we are committed to each other to bring ourselves as a family. This coming 5th of November will be a testament of our relationship. One that will last forever. I love you Desy Sitorus.

There are many things to be thankful too today. <a href="http://www.bango29.com/go/blog/2012/30-is-the-new-20" target="_blank">Last year</a>, I wrote that for the next 10 years of my life, I want to become part of a change. I voted Jokowi and Ahok the following months and they are now the number 1 and 2 of Jakarta. I was one of more than 50% ok Jakartans who took it to themselves to let change be introduced.

On a professional level, things have change too. A lot of the change were contributed by my undying desire to <a href="http://www.bango29.com/go/blog/2013/lost-and-found" target="_blank">create</a>. Exactly like my first intro into programming many many years ago, I still have that dumbfounded feeling whenever the challenge to create tickles my curiosity nerve. I mean, the more you know about something, the more you feel really dumb and little.

I am thankful that I have learned a new language and gain deeper grounds on other languages. Python, Android, PHP, JavaScript and Linux have been the core of my technological practices this past year. Especially with Python, I can get a taste of complicated yet simple practiced algorithms, machine learnings and even did a few websites with it.

Again, thank you all for the well wishes and I'm wishing you all a great and happy 7th of August 2013. Cheers and God bless you all.
