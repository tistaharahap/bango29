After a long break, I thought I wanna write about Android. This time it's Ice Cream Sandwich on a Galaxy Tab P1000. As always, for smartphone hacks, everyone should first go to <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com" target="_blank">XDA-Developers.com</a> and have a look if one of your gadgets has sub-forums. There's a specific thread for Galaxy Tab 7 First generation and ICS love is there.

This blog post is a confirmation that ICS works beautifully and incredibly fast and snappy on a Galaxy Tab P1000. It is as if you are having a multi-core Android device. Have look at <code>[ROM][ICS] AOKP (Android Open Kang Project) for P1000/L/N</code> <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1523174" target="_blank">here</a>. Follow the installation routines and you're good to go.

Here are the steps I took to get ICS working:
<ol>
	<li>I reflashed the Tab with a Gingerbread ROM and ClockworkMod Recovery using ODIN</li>
	<li>Downloaded Milestone #4 ROM for P1000 which is listed on the thread</li>
	<li>Downloaded Gapps from the link on the thread</li>
	<li>Downloaded a ClockworkMod flashable kernel for P1000 from the link on the thread</li>
	<li>Went into ClockworkMod Recovery (Power + Volume Down)</li>
	<li>Mounted USB Storage and copied ROM, Gapps and Kernel packages</li>
	<li>Unmounted USB Storage and flashed ROM, Kernel and Gapps last</li>
	<li>Wiped Cache, Data and Dalvik Cache</li>
	<li>Rebooted the system</li>
	<li>I got an incredibly smooth ICS working on the Galaxy Tab</li>
	<li>The ROM's performance was the best of any ROM I tried but the kernel kept nullifying the RIL stack, I downloaded HumberOS P1000 Kernel <a href="http://www.humberos.com.br/p/android-ics.html">here</a> and the problem disappeared</li>
	<li>A HAPPY GUY</li>
</ol>
Performance throughout the whole experience immediately alleviated by the ROM, not only the slick UI/UX had a welcomed boost but the Tab's performance itself is just amazing. I was on a rooted Stock Gingebread version previously and this update made my day!

Graphics &amp; 3D performance are amazing, everything is GPU Accelerated so it is a very smooth experience indeed. Gmail for ICS is also very relaxing!
