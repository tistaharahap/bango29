Having a really good time with Python and finding things to be a LOT merrier and enjoyable. That being said, I coded OAUTHnesia for Python; an OAUTH v1.0a client for Urbanesia's API.

A tutorial <a href="http://www.scotttorborg.com/python-packaging/minimal.html" target="_blank">here</a> really describes how easy it is to submit your own packages to PyPi. I followed through and to install this package is as easy as:

<code>(sudo) pip install oauthnesia</code>

OAUTHnesia is built upon <a href="http://python-requests.org" target="_blank">requests</a> and <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests-oauthlib" target="_blank">requests-oauthlib</a>.

Usage is really simple. To do a search about steaks, one can do below:
