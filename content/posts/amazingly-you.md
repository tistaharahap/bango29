Amazingly, you open my eyes again
you reach out and touchÃ¢â¬Â¦the greatest part of me
Amazingly, you feel what IÃ¢â¬â¢m all about
broken in piecesÃ¢â¬Â¦you mend my dying hope

r:
remember the strength that youÃ¢â¬â¢ve given me
today IÃ¢â¬â¢m standing on my own feet
because of you, you gave me back what IÃ¢â¬â¢ve lost so long

Amazingly, you bring out the best in me
you show me just how to give, cos loving you is whole
Amazingly, you feel what IÃ¢â¬â¢m all about
broken in piecesÃ¢â¬Â¦you mend my dying hope

b:
what lies inside of you
is a kind of love so new to me
it gives and it wants none
Amazingly You!
