Ok it's been a few months since my last post.

Just a few days ago I was looking at the statistics for Bango29.com and I found some interesting numbers like so:
<ol>
	<li>Each month the number of visits peaked at 30%. Especially around February when I started to guerrilla my way posting technology related tweets with my <a href="http://twitter.com/tista" target="_blank">@tista</a> twitter account.
<a href="http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/visits.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-158" title="Visits Surge" src="http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/visits.jpg" alt="Visits Surge" width="348" height="67" /></a></li>
	<li>Bango29.com is mostly visited by visitors from Russia, accounting for roughly 52% of the total pageviews. This is why I paid Google a little visit to translate a phrase, so here it goes <em><strong>"Privet, Rossiya"</strong></em>.
<a href="http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/from.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-159" title="Russia" src="http://www.bango29.com/go/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/from.jpg" alt="Russia" width="353" height="95" /></a></li>
	<li>Now this is the most interesting fact that got my attention right away. At least 91% of the total visit was a direct visit which means most of the visitors typed in Bango29.com into their browser's address bar. I'm flattered :) Hope this trend will keep continuing.

</ol>
So eventually I'm currently reworking Bango29.com and adding in some Twitter elements. I've come to love Twitter by the way. It feels great to share information and knowledge to others. I mean this. In the following weeks I will be experimenting with different approaches and my apologies if some of the experiments will have a bad effect for your eyes.

Lastly, I wanna give a big warm welcome to everyone and hopefully you all will enjoy this blog as much as I do. Thank you very much!
