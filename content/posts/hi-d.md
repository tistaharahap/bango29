My blog is a place for my own personal branding, well this post is the "personal" in personal branding. I rarely write like this but here goes anyways.

On my 30th birthday, just a few days before it, someone came into my life and she shook the living world out of me. Caught me off guard and boy The Guy Above knows what each of us need in His own perfect timing.

It didn't go as smooth or as planned or even close to perfect the first time around which is 2 months ago but at the second try, she makes thing happen for us. She showed me that we're both stupid when it comes about love cos none of us really know what the four letter word means. BUT, it'll be so much amazing to experience everything together.

Thanks for knowing me more than me.

Let's spend the better part of our lives as one. You're amazing!
