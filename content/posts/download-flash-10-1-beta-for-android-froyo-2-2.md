Okay so you've updated your Android to Froyo 2.2 but when you go into Flash enabled websites, what's supposed to be Flash applets is just a blue box with a question mark. So other than the speed acceleration and other below-the-hood upgrades, where's that Flash support Google and Adobe is barking about?

Don't get all too disappointed because you can install Flash now. For some reason, in my Nexus One, Flash wasn't there. Fear not, all you have to do is just click on the link below and it'll open up Market and lets you install Flash 10.1 Beta for your Android. So without further ado, here's the link:

<p style="text-align: left;">You must open the link on your Android browser! Opening it elsewhere will get you a Flash player download for your OS. So enjoy Flash!</p>
