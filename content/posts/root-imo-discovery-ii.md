I just got this China made phone today. My first time having one and I must say I am very impressed with the performance. Not just on paper, it's a powerful 1.3 GHz quad core phone indeed.

First and foremost, `root` access is mandatory to hack this phone further. It's a newer phone being released just last month on February 2014. Resources are limited at the moment.

#### Rooting

As it turns out, it's dead simple. Some time ago I read about [Framaroot](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2130276). It's a one click root for most devices. Download from the link and install it to your phone.

```
$ adb install Framaroot-1.9.1.apk
```

Afterwards, just run the app and choose `Barahir` as the rooting method.

#### Antutu Score

I decided to pit the Imo Discovery II against my Nexus 4 by running Antutu Benchmark. Both phones uses fresh installs from Google Play. They are both quad core phones with the Nexus 4 running at 1.5 Ghz, slightly higher than Imo's 1.3 GHz.

So it seems that it is **17.184** vs **19.998**. I bought the Nexus 4 for IDR 5.000.000 while the IMO Discovery II costs IDR 1.600.000. That for me as a developer is **GREAT** news!

Time will tell but if this trend of cheap and performant Android devices continues, I'm finding myself to focus more of my efforts on Android. This coincides perfectly with the ability to sell Android apps on Google Play from Indonesian developers.

I am a happy developer.
