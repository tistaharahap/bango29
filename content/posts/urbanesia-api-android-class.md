It's been quite a day today. Did some code reworking with an app I showed you guys in my last posts. I decided to publish the Urbanesia class to Google Code and make it GPL v2.

I encourage everyone to contribute and make more modifications. I'm not as experienced as others in Java, would love to learn more. The Google Code URL is:
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://code.google.com/p/urbanesia-api-android/" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/urbanesia-api-android/</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Enjoy and empower yourselves developers!</p>
