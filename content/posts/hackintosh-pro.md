Since my [last](https://bango29.com/nvme-hackintosh-high-sierra/) Hackintosh post, I overdid myself with a new one. This time I'm switching sides to AMD fro the GPU with a simple reason because Nvidia cards are not Mojave ready. I've tried but without hardware acceleration, you can't do anything right.

Before anything else, this is the final spec:

* Intel Core i7 8700k
* Cooler Master MasterLiquid Pro 120 CPU water cooler
* MSI Z370 Gaming M5
* HyperX 16GBx2 DDR4 3200 MHz
* Samsung Evo 960 Pro 250 GB (boot drive)
* Samsung Evo 960 Pro 500 GB (store)
* Asus ROG Strix RX580 8GB OC
* Thermal Take MasterBox MB500 Casing

The first thing I'm glad of is the Mojave installation. Because I'm using an RX580, Mojave supports it out of the box. No more annoying low resolution when installing, feels like a real Mac.

I might also add that this is the first time I built a Hackintosh with cutting edge CPU/Mobo. That said, even the OS: Mojave is still new. There's no MultiBeast, yet. But you have UniBeast for Mojave. That said, I had to resort to copying the installer's EFI folder into my boot drive's EFI folder.

While writing this blog post, I was watching Apple's October 30th 2018 event. No Apple hardware is going to match the specs above. The single valid reason for building Hackintosh is still: **upgradeability**.

Fast forward a week or so after I wrote the first section, I am very impressed with my new Hackintosh. Everything runs snappier, especially for web browsing. My (almost) 1 year old Macbook Pro is not so fun anymore using it to browse.

One area that I want to improve is CPU cooling. The CPU when used for coding and web browsing hovers at around 40-45 degrees celsius. I want to swap the 120 mm radiator with a 240 mm. Case for later.

The other area is GPU, I'm not getting enough performance playing X-Plane 11 in 4K. My suspicion is my PSU is not delivering the power needed for my overclocked RX 580. A happy problem though.

Never get tired of building hackintoshes, well worth the research.
