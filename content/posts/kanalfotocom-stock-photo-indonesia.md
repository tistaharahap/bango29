This website is aimed as THE portal of Indonesian stock photos. Currently still in the process of piecing it all together. What I can tell you, it's a purebred of OpenSource magic and <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> will be its best friend.

A first for me to incorporate Facebook wonders with websites. My first start was <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php" target="_blank">Facebook Connect</a>. The Connect feature is already live on the homepage. Although now not 100% yet, it's a preview of what's to come. The next step is an application.
