Above those giant trees where creatures seeks to rest
The sound of lightning &amp; thunder wakes up mother earth

Swirls and transforms dust into life
Flowers once again bloom to die
Only to bloom again and again
in another dimension of love..
as love warms solitude..with hope

b:
As a star brings hope to sailor,
time brings wisdom to be,
to be pondered upon..

r:
The royal pardon your highness was truly
HEAVEN SENT, HEAVEN SENT, HEAVEN SENT
The royal pardon your highness was truly
HEAVEN SENT, HEAVEN SENT, HEAVEN SENT
