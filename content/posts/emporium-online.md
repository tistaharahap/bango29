An online shop built for Faudzan Faudzi Network located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The website was built upon a magnificient piece of application called CubeCart. If you visit the site, we have added custom modules other than what CubeCart provides. We even added an Mp3 player to suit the clientÃ¢â¬â¢s requirements so that shoppers can easily be swayed with the songs served.

The online shop is a testament to our vision of integrating current technology wonders together with a pleasant and pleasing design. The design for the online shop was based on the concept Ã¢â¬Åless is moreÃ¢â¬Å. Below you can see a screenshot of the online shop.
