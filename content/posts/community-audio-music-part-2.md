On to the next part of Community Audio a.k.a my own music hosted at <a href="http://www.archive.org" target="_blank">The Internet Archive</a>. Most of the song I wrote are hosted over there while still there are other hosted at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/tistanina" target="_blank">Myspace</a> and <a href="http://www.ilike.com/artist/Mr.+Tista/" target="_blank">iLike</a>. Looking at the statistics, The Internet Archive is a clear winner,Â offeringÂ access to larger crowds.

One of my favorite song is "<em>My Good Friend</em>". I remembered when writing this song, I was just fooling around with my guitar and my cousin Ina came from out of nowhere and she just started to sing along. In the end we came up with a song that is spontaneous and honest. The song had over than 750 downloads.

Another song I wrote out ofÂ spontaneityÂ is "Dirimu Ada". Utin a friend of me and Ina's had a collection of poems she shared with us. When we scanned through the poems, we fell in love with this particular poem. It's a song about longing your beloved and also about gratitude towards to that person. Thank you Lord for friends and family :) The song got over than 450 downloads.

<p style="text-align: left;">Now comes to a song I wrote first before any other songs :) Well it's a happy yet gloomy song. Yes it's about love. Broken but strong. I went from Kuala Lumpur - Singapore - Kuala Lumpur - Singapore - Kuala Lumpur to give this particular song to someone. Now we're friends like never before, learned a lot about love. The song is titled "<em>As Good As It Gets</em>" Everytime I listen to it, I get giggles lol. Sung by Angel, I'm on guitars. Downloaded over than 1100 times.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The last song of this part is titled "<em>Inside of You</em>". Dedicated to someone I have loved with every beat of my heart. Written on the first few weeks we were together. The first song I wrote to her and still have more to be written into more songs. My apologies for the audio quality, I recorded it using a cell phone :) Not much downloads, 39 to be precise but this song meant a lot to me. Sung by me while playing my guitar.</p>
