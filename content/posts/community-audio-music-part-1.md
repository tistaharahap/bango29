It's been more than 5 years since I uploaded my first Creative Commons Licensed music now referred as Community Audio at <a href="http://archive.org" target="_blank">archive.org</a>. Bottom-line, looking at the statistics, I was in smiles :) The Internet Archive is more accessible to the mass it reads.

There's this song that I feel is in tune with #StartupLokal hehehe. When I wrote the song, I was on a transitional phase. The song is titled "<em>Ain't Sorry</em>" and it was sung by my cousin Ina. The song had more than 1200 downloads :D It's a brave song and I'm grateful a self-development NGO in the USA is using the song in one of their trainings, something I did made some difference in the world, be grateful! Stream it down below :D

<p style="text-align: left;">Another song that surprised me was "<em>Adalah Satu</em>". This was not an easy song. My best friend handed me a piece of paper with lyrics he wrote to express his feelings about his relationship at the moment. It was tough because I knew what he is going through. Anyways, this song raked in over than 1400 downloads. Vocals by me and Utin with Ina as backing vocals and piano.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">"<em>Heaven Sent</em>" is a song I wrote from one of my old friend Suz's poems. The most meaningful lyric line for me is "<em>Flowers once again bloom to die, only to bloom again and again in another dimension of LOVE..</em>" Thanks Suz, it's an inspiration. I was in guitar and vocals for this song.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">For this last song of the night "<em>Dialah</em>", I didn't know it'll be the most downloaded at over than 4600 downloads. Thank you all for downloading! Actually this song is right at the edge of average. The typical surviving a heartbreak lyrics. Well that relates exactly to all of us right? I don't believe there's anyone in this God given earth have never had a heartbreak at least once. The song was sung by Ina, I was in guitars.</p>
