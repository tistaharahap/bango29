Urbanesia was invited to Microsoft Window 8's Bootcamp in Bandung last weekend. Me, Arieditya and Aditya went there to see and experience ourselves the technical depth provided by the Windows 8 team. To cut things short, the experience was reinvigorating! After a bunch of process of liking, hating, yeah right-ing, hating, liking and now loving, I felt Microsoft's attention to developers is an example to follow for other big names.

I don't know how the ecosystem is pre Windows 8 but now, Microsoft is implementing (copying) best practices &amp; ideas that are there in the Open Source community for years before and optimize them at the kernel level. This is a very bold move, exactly the same like the kind of UI/UX they're offering with Windows 8, <strong>reimagined</strong>.

For much of the days in Bandung, we were all coding and trainers were there to help us along the way. The trainers doesn't actually have hands on Windows 8 experience but their in depth knowledge about the technology behind Microsoft is incredibly helpful. Always ready to answer any question we might have and even code a few lines. This helped the Urbanesia team a lot, we even discovered some of our API outputs are giving Windows based developers headaches, we fixed it.

To tell you the truth, after going into some of these technical events in Indonesia and abroad, Windows 8 Bootcamp is the most useful for developers. So a big applause for the Windows 8 team and the trainers, you guys rock!
