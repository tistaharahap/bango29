I'm one of the happiest Nexus One owner today! Thanks to the guys at <a href="http://android.modaco.com/content/google-nexus-one-nexusone-modaco-com/309286/frf50-froyo-pre-rooted-update-zip/" target="_blank">Modaco</a>, my Nexus One is now an official Froyo! It's the biggest smile I've had since a while lol. Updating it was a breeze as long as your Nexus One is already rooted. Next up is a walkthrough on how to get a Froyo for yours.

First of before going any further, you MUST root your Nexus One first. Follow the instructions from my earlier post <a href="http://www.bango29.com/go/blog/2010/rooting-my-nexus-one-cyanogen-mod" target="_blank">here</a>. After it's rooted, the happy grins begin:
<ol>
	<li>Download the image from the post at Modaco above or a mirror provided <a href="http://bango29.com/android/update-nexusone-FRF50-signed.zip" target="_blank">here</a> in this blog (MD5 Sum: 946229291ed8e24cd80aeb4a66ca2fc7)</li>
	<li>Copy the image to your Nexus One's SD Card root directory and leave it as is in its zip format</li>
	<li>Turn off your Nexus One</li>
	<li>Boot into the bootloader by pressing the trackball and power button at the same time</li>
	<li>Use your Volume Down button to scroll to Recovery and press the power button</li>
	<li>At the recovery image options, use your trackball to select Wipe and wipe everything except SD Card partition</li>
	<li>Now get back to the initial options by pressing Volume Down</li>
	<li>Select the Flash from SD Card option and you're set</li>
	<li>It will flash your Nexus One and after that it will take you back to the Recovery Image options. No worries, select Reboot System</li>
	<li>Welcome to Froyo!</li>
</ol>
Easy right?
