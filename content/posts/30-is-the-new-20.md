First and foremost, Happy 7th of August everyone! This is a day of joy as the default theme. Have a blessed and fruitful Tuesday for everyone.

Looking back 10 years ago when I was having my 20th birthday, it was a different experience. Back then was full of ideals, theories and mostly anger. Those 3 things shaped the last 10 years of my life in it entirety. Now, that anger have been turned more into spirit, a rebellion spirit I might assert. I still refuse to go with mainstream ideals and choosing to make my choices/decisions based on creative thinkings that override norms.

It's that time (again) to experience another 10 years of my life with the same determinations believing that <strong>1 is enough</strong> to <strong>inspire</strong> and contribute to <strong>CHANGE</strong>. Nothing is consistent, the only consistency is change and therefore change is inevitable. I'm gonna spend the next decade to do exactly that. The kind of change that filter non-sense, bullshit and opportunists out of the ecosystem.

Thank you friends and families for all the wishes, God bless you all and let this happy day for me becomes yours also.

<em>Viva la vida!</em>
