This particular gadget has been poised as the iPhone killer. What do you think? By the way, I'm not gonna go into detailed specifications, that you can <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=palm%20pre" target="_blank">google</a>.

At a glance the Palm Pre feature what I feel an interesting combination of 2 worlds which are Microsoft's and Apple's, well ok since lately RIM's Blackberry is making its name globally, let's make it 3 worlds.

Palm Pre features a slide down QWERTY keyboard which is common in both Windows Mobile and Blackberry gadgets. The LCD is a 320x480 pixels screen to mimic iPhone's multitouch LCD. Yes it's a multitouch gadget so expect an exciting experience! Did I mention it feature an accelerometer as well?

As a programmer, what really trigger my curiosity is that the GUI relies on HTML/CSS and JavaScript to form its interface. This really negates any learning curve for web programmers like me. It's a fantastic piece of engineering feat I must say.

The internals are also just as amazing as its interface. UMTS/HSDPA network support is its carriage for wireless broadband. It's also a GPS enabled gadget and it's packed with a whopping 8 GB of internal memory. There's also a cool way to charge the batteries, you just put the Palm Pre on top of its charging device and voila, wireless charging. The charger is named Palm Touchstone.

What's more impressive is that the Palm Pre is a "cloud" based gadget. That means that your data reside either online or on the device itself. The term "mobile" is redefined! You can really stay connected at all times with the Palm Pre.

Palm Pre is an evolution coming true. Its concept is nothing new but to implement it for the public market, it's quite a bold move. Let's see if it'll make an impact like what iPhone when it was first announced.

With heaps of feature and technology on its shoulder, I really hope the infrastructure is ready. I mean, what is the use of a high tech gadget when we can't do anything right? Anyways, the Palm Pre is rumored to be priced at US$ 399 for an unlock version and US$ 200 for a network-contracted version. It's quite a reasonable price for a full feature device like this.

Last but not least, I hope to see this nifty gadget in Indonesia soon enough! And here's a video from <a href="http://www.phonescoop.com" target="_blank">PhoneScoop.com</a> reviewing the Palm Pre.
