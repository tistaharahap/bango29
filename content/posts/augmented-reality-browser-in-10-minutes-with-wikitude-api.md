This blog post is a simple tutorial to demonstrate how easy it is to set up a full fledge Augmented Reality browser with Wikitude API. It will only take 10 minutes of your time in its most simplest form, ready to be customized with your own needs. It should be easy enough to let you innovate on your own.

For this to happen, I assume you already have these items ready with your setup:
<ul>
	<li>Eclipse (Preferably Indigo)</li>
	<li>Android Developer Tools for Eclipse <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html" target="_blank">here</a></li>
	<li>Android SDK <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">here</a></li>
	<li>Wikitude SDK <a href="http://www.wikitude.com/developer/wikitude-sdk" target="_blank">here</a></li>
</ul>

The project is live at Github: <a href="https://github.com/tistaharahap/ARBrowser" target="_blank">https://github.com/tistaharahap/ARBrowser</a>

I believe codes will speak louder than words ;)
