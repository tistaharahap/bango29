Good evening all. Continuing my Guest Post at <a href="http://dailysocial.net/2010/05/14/poligami-ala-augmented-reality/" target="_blank">DailySocial.net</a>, I'm beta testing an Android app titled <strong>Poligamy</strong> lol. Need your help :) It's an app to test real world HTTP connections and also to test Location-related features. I added an Augmented Reality viewer to trigger your geek souls hehe.

<strong>Poligamy</strong> is built upon the <a href="http://www.bango29.com/go/blog/2010/urbanesia-api-android-class" target="_blank">Urbanesia class I posted before</a>. It gets its POI data from Urbanesia and distribute the data into 3 main parts of the app which are<strong> List View</strong>, <strong>Map View</strong> and <strong>Augmented Reality View</strong>. It's still in its early stages so it's not too fancy, will do fancy things after it's rock solid :)

Some notes, for the Augmented Reality View to work, you will need Wikitude installed. If you haven't install it, the app will ask you to install Wikitude. The app is compiled for Android 2.1 (Eclair) with Google API. I used a lot of 2.1 features so my apologies for &lt; 2.1 Android phone users.

Anyways, before going through, please make sure the followings first so you can install the app directly from your Browser:
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Settings </strong>- <strong>Applications</strong></li>
	<li>Check on <strong>Unknown Sources</strong></li>
</ol>
This <strong>DOES NOT</strong> do any malicious things and you have to take my word on it. I will share the source code if you're that interested.

<strong>INVITATION</strong>: To all location based data provider in <strong>Indonesia</strong>, if you want your data source to be included into <strong>Poligamy</strong> or any other inquiries, I would gladly do so. Please <a href="http://twitter.com/tista" target="_blank">tweet me</a> and let's talk about it over coffee. Thanks.

Scan the QR code below on your Android phone to download and install <strong>Poligamy</strong>.

<p style="text-align: left;">Would appreciate it if you'd be so kind to <a href="http://twitter.com/tista" target="_blank">tweet me</a> or Comment this post about how the app is performing with your Android phone. Thanks in advance, enjoy <strong>Poligamy</strong>!</p>
